# Space AI Game

This is a programming game in which the user writes JavaScript code to control
a spaceship in order to complete some objective. The user gets an API with
certain inputs and outputs to sense and react to the environment. This API
includes functions for things like radar, checking ammo, checking objective
location, accelerating, turning, firing, etc. Documentation is available
to the player. The objective might be to get to a specified location, to
destroy all enemy ships or outposts, to defend your own ships or outposts,
etc. Each level can be specified in a standard JSON format that supplies
the initial conditions and win conditions, so it is easy to create new
challenges.
